    <h1>Dear Swarnika ❤</h1>
   <p>
Sometimes I wonder if the stars envy you, because no matter how brightly they shine, they could never outshine the light you carry within.   
You are not just someone I think about, you are the thought that lingers quietly in the background of my day, the melody that plays in my silence, and the reason why the world feels softer and kinder. I have seen beauty before, but with you, beauty has meaning—it’s in the way you laugh without trying, the way your presence makes every room feel like home, and the way your absence feels like a missing piece of my soul. There’s a certain magic about you, a charm that is not loud or demanding, but gentle, deep, and impossible to ignore. And though I may never have the courage to tell you this face to face, know that my heart has already chosen you in a way that feels both terrifying and wonderful.
When I imagine the future, I don’t see grand palaces or riches; I see your hand resting in mine, your smile lighting up my darkest nights, and your voice turning ordinary days into poetry. Even the simplest moments with you feel like eternity wrapped in perfection. Every word you say has a rhythm that plays in my chest long after the conversation ends. And every time you look at me, even if unknowingly, it feels like the universe pauses just to watch. I hope this proves that i love you .

<b> A Cute Shayari for My Cutie :</b><br>
“तेरे बिना ज़िन्दगी से कोई शिकवा तो नहीं,  
तेरे बिना ज़िन्दगी भी लेकिन ज़िन्दगी तो नहीं।  
तू अगर सामने हो तो मोहब्बत गहरी लगती है,  
वरना ये दुनिया भी मुझे पराई लगती है।”
